A reaction is very similar to running an `update()`, except that it's an update that runs when a certain value has changed in your store.

Their API is very similar to [Subscriptions](subscribe.md) in the way they watch values, the difference being that Reactions allow you to react and change your store's state at the same time in a "batched" way. Subscriptions only send you the new values. The reason these two are separated is for performance reasons - if you do not need to react and change your store's state on an update, rather use [subscriptions](subscribe.md).

Reactions on a store are run directly after a call to `update()` on that store. They check their watched value in the store, and if changed, react with further state updates as you define. This is all batched in one go before notifying our React components to re-render as needed.

## Creating a reaction

You register a reaction by calling `createReaction()` on your store:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--JavaScript-->
```jsx
StoreName.createReaction(watch, reaction);
```

<!--TypeScript-->
```tsx
type TReactionFunction<S, T> = (watched:  T, draft: S, original: S, lastWatched: T) => void;

StoreName.createReaction(watch: (state: S) => T, reaction: TReactionFunction<S, T>): () => void
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

Similar to how we select sub-state with `useStoreState()` and `<InjectStoreState>`, the first argument, `watch`, is function which returns a sub-selection of the store's state. This is the value we will be watching for changes:

```
storeState => storeState.watchedValue;
```

The watched value is checked every time the store is updated. If the value has changed, the `reaction` function is run. This is done in a performant way - reactions are run directly after updates before notifying your React components to update.

The `reaction` function:

```jsx
(watched, draft, original, lastWatched) => { //do things };
```

The new watched value will be passed as the first argument,`watched` 

The next two arguments are the same as those used whe running `update()` on a store:

* You can mutate your store directly, using `draft`

* `original` is passed as a performance consideration. It is exactly the same as `draft` but without all the `immer` magic. It's a plain object of your state.
  * **Why?** Referencing values directly on your `draft` object can be a performance hit in certain situations because of the way that immer works internally (JavaScript proxies) - so if you need to _reference_ the current store state, you should use `original`. But if you want to _change_ it, you use `draft`. [Read more in immer's docs](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/performance#for-expensive-search-operations-read-from-the-original-state-not-the-draft).

The last argument is the last watched value, passed as a convenience for if you ever need to refer to it.
  
## Example

Listening to a [Cron Tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) string value, `crontab`, and calculating other values such as a human readable time and the previous and next dates of the cron run:

```tsx
CronJobStore.createReaction(s => s.crontab, (crontab, draft) => {
    if (crontab !== null) {
      const resp = utils.getTimesAndTextFromCronTab({ crontab });
      if (resp.positive) {
        draft.currentCronJobTimesAndText = resp.payload;
      } else {
        draft.currentCronJobTimesAndText = {
          text: `Bad crontab`,
          times: {
            prevTime: null,
            nextTime: null,
          },
        };
      }
    } else {
      draft.currentCronJobTimesAndText = {
         times: {
           prevTime: null,
           nextTime: null,
         },
         text: `No crontab`,
       };
    }
  }
);
```

## Unsubscribe from a reaction (client-side only)

You may unsubscribe from a reaction on the client side of your app by simply running the function which is returned when you created the reaction.
